# alphaSwap
Fully functional fork of UNI-V2 defi protocol with an added function to bootstrap liquidity from the original UniSwap. This allows the user to deposit LP tokens from UniSwap in order to provide liquidity to alphaSwap, in turn receiving the BonusToken "BTK". BTK will include a governance aspect which allows holders to vote on proposals for the future of the protocol.
